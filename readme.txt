This is a git repository for our Vex C++ Pro source code for vex robotics

There are raw source files for the Cpp and H files in each of the 4 subfolders for robot/color combinations. This is the code changes that are important on each branch. 

DO NOT TRUST THE COMPILED VEX CODE INCLUDED -- Assume that this can be anywhere between the original branch position up to the current state.
As such, ALWAYS copy the raw source into the Vex Coding studio if you want to build off this branch.
